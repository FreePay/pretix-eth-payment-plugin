// Design note: when the real 3cities SDK is ready, this entire subsystem of tracking transaction details pending server submission can be managed inside the SDK. The client API can be quite thin, maybe just (1) provide a primary key for each transaction details (orderId, accountId, function to generate an accountId given 3cities txn details, etc), and (2) provide a function that accepts a pending (primaryKey, txDetails) and returns a Promise that resolves iff the pending details were successfully submitted to the server; this allows the client to own any submission logic, while making it easy to mark tx details as submitted inside the 3cities SDK.
